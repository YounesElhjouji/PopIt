Relationships evolution simulator

This is an old project of mine. It is a simple simulation of reproduction patterns that I made in order to tweak the variables (selectiveness, average lifetime, etc) and see how that affects the population. I also made this simulation to famirialize myself with basic Javascript. This web app is my first experience coding in Javascript.
